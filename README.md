# Analysis of Attendance of Medical Appointments.
## by Ezekiel Okato


## Project

The aim of this project was to clean, explore and analyse the [*Medical No Shows*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments) dataset which contained 110,527 medical appointments and 14 associated variables.

For this project, the following questions were posed that the analysis seeked to answer:
- What is the Age Distribution and how does it Affect Appointment Attendance?
- What is the Gender Distribution and how does it Affect Appointment Attendance?
- What is the Relationship between Neighbourhoods and Appointment Attendance?
- What is the Effect of SMS Reception on Appointment Attendance?
- Does Scholarship has an Effect on Appointment Attendance?
- What is the Effect of Waiting Period on Appointment Attendance?



## Summary and Findings
The Dataset underwent cleaning to remove some columns, rename variables and change datatypes of some variables prior to exploratory analysis and visualization

From the analysis conducted, it is concluded that:
- There were more female than male patients and this was reflected in their attendance.
- Most patients favoured week-long waiting periods.
- Most patients were middle-age adults and this was reflected in the attendance.
- Older patients showed up for their appointments more.
- Neighbourhoods were not a major factor in attendance since most patients in all neighbourhoods showed up for their appointments.
- Scholarship and receiving SMS were of little significance for patients scheduling and attending their appointments.
